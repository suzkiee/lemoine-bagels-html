- need to fix the padding bottom for the indents in bkfast specials; otherwise about 95%



- finishing touches
    * positioning for the main div for the menu - main tag
    * positioning for the menu header
    * banner image width is not taking the full width
    * footer is not taking the entire full width of the view port

- maybe we can add 2 classes for some of the elements like the paddings for the indented left rows


- need to fix and organize css code!! clean up code at the end
** DEFINITELY NEED TO CLEAN UP CODE.. its not dry...


headers in menu for left side dont match up as you scroll down...
